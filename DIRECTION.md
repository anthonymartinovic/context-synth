# Direction

Development is focused on delivering the core pipeline:

* Define foundational schemas
* Implement normalization behavior
* Implement synthesis behavior including weighting and budget-aware assembly
* Establish extensibility interfaces
* Prepare delivery surfaces for CLI usage and editor integration

Work advances directly toward the trajectory described in VISION.md.
